Smala
=====

Scalable modular neural networks

Smala is a scalable and modular machine learning toolbox written in Python and 
Fortran released under the MIT license. Smala has a simple Python user interface
 and uses Fortran for computationally intensive tasks. Smala is based on neural 
networks an implements different modules such as spatial convolutions, 
multi-layer perceptrons and structure embeddings. Smala modular design is 
inspired from the Torch5 library.

Installation
============

Install the required dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy gfortran python-dev

Download the sources:

    svn co https://smala.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smala smala

Compile the Fortran sources:

    cd smala/smala && f2py -c base.f -m base && cd ../..

Then, either modify the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the path 
where you have checked out. If you are using bash:

    PYTHONPATH="$HOME/smala"

... or if you are using csh:

    setenv PYTHONPATH "${HOME}/smala"

... or move the folder to the /usr/local/lib/pythonXX/ folder where XX is your 
version of Python.
